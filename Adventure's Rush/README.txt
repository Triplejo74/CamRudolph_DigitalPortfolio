This game is one of the first games that I created. It is made in python and is based on a series of if statements
that run a player through a series of challenges. There are two areas in the game, the Town and the Cave, that 
each funtion for the player. The Town allows the player to sell their loot, upgrade weapons and armor, and buy potions.
The Cave is an area where the player will try to get to the end and kill as many monsters on the way with out dying.
