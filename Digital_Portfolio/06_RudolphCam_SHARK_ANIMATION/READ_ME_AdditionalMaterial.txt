	This folder should ideally contain anything else you may have made during your personal time or for other classes that may have used your skills from this class. This is a great place to drop images from your other schoolwork, or even personal projects, so I can get some context on what you're using your new DIGITAL DESIGN skills for. 

	If this folder is empty, it WILL NOT EFFECT YOUR FINAL PORTFOLIO GRADE... but I will be sad because I like seeing your other work. <3
