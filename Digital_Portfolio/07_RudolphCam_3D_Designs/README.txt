These Files are a collection of 3D designs that I have made over a few years using Blender. I will list what each file is
what it was and why it was made.

Bleb Mini:
This project was made during my time in a 3d printing class. We were task to make blob monsters and I went with a humonoid 
approach. After that I decided to make use of the print and put a base on it. Putting the base allowed me to print it on 
a small scale and use it as a monster in my Dungeons and Dragons campaign. 

Clue, Food, and Treasure Chest Token:
These projects were made for the spinner and counter files to indacte what token is being made in a game of Magic the 
Gathering. They are intended to fit in the top of those prints in a designated slot. 

Fusion Core:
This project is based off of the Fusion Core power source from the popular game Fallout 4, made by bethesda. It's purpose,
is to hold a commander deck for the commander format of Magic the Gathering. The bottom two pieces are supposed to be 
combined, but were seperated for ease of printing. The middle has holes in it that the connectors are supposed to fit into
which allows the top part to slide on to for it to close the deck in. The lid is made to twist on to the top section, to 
allow the player to keep any tokens or dice in it. 

Mari Mini Fig: 
This project is a itteration of the Bleb Mini. It was made after the creation of the Bleb to be a secondary monster of the
Bleb. Once the Bleb took enough damage it would then split into two Mari figures. Letting one to run away and the other to 
and allow the other to run away.

Sloop:
The sloop project is based off the Sloop from the popular game Sea of Thieves, made by Rare. It incorperates many of 
similar features that the sloop in the game does. The reason that I recreated it was to be printed and used in Dungeons
and Dragons sessions. In other files, I have cut up parts of the ship to be easier to print and to allow access to the 
lower level in games. 

Small Token Counter:
The Small Token Counter was made to be used in Magic the Gathering games to count the amount of tokens or any kind of 
counter that you would need. This model is supposed to go hand in hand with the other Tokens listed above to display what 
you are making in game. This design is a closed face design that would make it hard for other players to see how much you
have of the specified item. 

Spinner:
The spinner is very similar in use to the Token Counter but this design is made with an open top for everyone to see what
the player is making. I use this one the most to make energy for the deck that fits into the Fusion core that I previously
designed. 

Viking Helm:
The Viking Helm is supposed to be an other commander box for the commander format in Magic the Gathering. This design
has a removable head piece that slides out towards the front. After sliding out, it would allow the player to put a 
commander deck in the head. There is also a slot behind the deck slot for a place to put dice or any other markers that 
the player could need.
